# L03 Stage 1 - prior-day sweep and reclaim, against matched placebo regions

> **Stage: S7** (multiplicity). Cleared S1-S6; see `reports/STAGES.md` for the
> numbering. This report was written under the retired "Stage 1" label, which maps to
> S6-S8.

**Verdict: null. 0 of 18 cells separate against 0.90 expected by chance.** 18 trials spent.

Every figure is **(real level) minus (matched placebo region)**, MGC only, **H=180
pre-registered as the sole horizon**, cost floor **0.65 bps**. Trials were logged BEFORE the
run. The condition is sweep-and-reclaim: price exceeds the level by >= m ticks then closes
back inside within k bars, traded **counter to the penetration**.

**The control is weaker than a displaced level** (`decisions.md` 37). It equalises where a
region sits and how often price reaches it, and **nothing about how price arrived**. A
difference here means "behaves differently from an equally-reachable arbitrary region",
which is weaker than "behaves differently given the same approach".

## Results

Range **-2.007 to +2.404 bps** across `prior_rth` and `prior_full`. Best cell
`prior_full m=4 k=2` at **+2.404 bps,
p=0.1145** - nominally the largest in the run and
still not separated.

## Reading

**Nothing separates**, and unlike L02 the mechanism here is not instrument-specific: prior-day
extremes as reference prices is not an equity story, so MGC is a legitimate test of the
registered claim. MGC-only is an event-count constraint alone - MNQ's best cell sits at 3,762
against a 5,884 floor, 0.64x.

Both level types matched their placebo (`decisions.md` 37), so no cell was excluded.

Events 1,699-4,679 per cell against a 2,862 floor. The larger cells had adequate power; the
smallest did not, and the entry records which.

**This is the stronger of the two nulls.** L02's mechanism was never exposed; L03's was, on an
instrument where it should hold, and produced nothing.

**Status: retired.**
