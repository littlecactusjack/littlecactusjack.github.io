"""Catalog / registry consistency — an integrity test, per CLAUDE_FUTURES.md §7.

`hypotheses.yaml` is what the pipeline reads at Stage 0. `FUTURES_STRATEGY_HYPOTHESES.md`
is the human document. If they disagree, the pipeline silently tests something the catalog
does not describe, and every trial logged against that hypothesis is mislabelled — which
poisons the trial count N that DSR, PBO and SPA all depend on (§6).

That already happened once in the crypto project: an entry carried a horizon taken from its
prose header rather than its grid, expanding a hypothesis already at the parameter cap and
producing eighteen phantom trials silently. This test exists so that class of drift fails
loudly instead of being noticed by eye.
