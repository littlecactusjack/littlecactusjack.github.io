"""The only sanctioned way to run a Stage 1 hypothesis. CLAUDE_FUTURES.md §6.

    with stage1_run("F04", provenance="native") as log:
        cells = run(...)
        log.record(cells)

WHY THIS EXISTS. `stats/trials.py` — the hash-chained append-only trial log — was ported
from the crypto repo with its tests, and its tests passed, and **no runner ever called it**.
Three hypotheses were run and 342 trials spent before anyone noticed, because N was being
reconstructed by counting rows in output files. A log nothing writes to is not a weaker
control than no log; it is worse, because its passing tests imply a discipline that is not
being practised.

WHAT THE CONTEXT MANAGER GUARANTEES. On clean exit it asserts the log actually grew. A
runner that computes cells and forgets to record them raises `UnloggedRun` instead of
exiting 0 with a tidy report — the failure is loud and happens in the run that caused it,
not three weeks later when someone recomputes N.

It does NOT guarantee the count is right, only that it is non-zero. Nothing can verify from
inside that every cell was passed in. That is what `tests/test_trial_logging.py` checks
structurally, by refusing to let a runner module exist without going through here.

CONTROLS DO NOT SPEND TRIALS. `stage1_run` routes a control's records to
`measurements.jsonl` instead of `trials.jsonl`, derived from the registry's `is_control`
rather than passed in by the caller - the failure mode being a runner that forgets. See
`log_path_for`.

PROVENANCE IS PART OF THE RECORD, not a comment. Trials reconstructed from output files
after the fact are marked `reconstructed`, because they are weaker evidence than natively
logged ones: their timestamps are the backfill's, their ordering within a run is lost, and
nothing proves the output file was not edited. They still count toward N — a look at the
data is a look at the data — but a reader must be able to tell the two apart without
consulting git history.
